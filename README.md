# steam-utility
A C# .NET Framework WPF application that uses Steam's metadata files to make a small utility.

## How it Works
It looks into your registry for Steam's install location. It then parses the `*.acf` files (this is the reason that the program takes awhile to fully load and can appear to freeze)

The advanced mode has a search function.
